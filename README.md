# Feature_Selection

Here presented theoretical and practical parts of Feature Selection via Mutual Information. Jan Mielniczuka, Pawe≈Ç Teisseyre created an 
algorithm for selecting the most relevant features. the main differences from other information methods is that we do not know the true number 
of revevant features. Authors propose stopping rule that decide on each step whether or not to stop selection
